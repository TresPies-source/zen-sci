# Specific Aims

The long-term goal of this research is to develop computational methods that
accurately predict protein structures from amino acid sequences. Protein
misfolding is implicated in numerous diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
and cystic fibrosis. Despite recent advances in machine learning approaches,
significant gaps remain in predicting the structures of membrane proteins and
intrinsically disordered regions.

**Aim 1: Develop a hybrid deep learning architecture for membrane protein
structure prediction.** We will combine graph neural networks with
transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture both local and global
structural features of membrane proteins.

**Aim 2: Create a validated benchmark dataset for intrinsically disordered
protein regions.** We will curate experimental data from NMR spectroscopy and
cryo-EM studies to establish ground truth for disordered region prediction.

**Aim 3: Integrate multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations with deep learning
predictions.** We will develop a framework that uses physics-based simulations
to refine and validate machine learning predictions.

The successful completion of these aims will provide the research community with
new tools for understanding protein function and accelerating drug discovery for
conformational diseases.

# Research Strategy

## A. Significance

Protein structure prediction remains one of the grand challenges in
computational biology. While AlphaFold2 and related methods have dramatically
improved prediction accuracy for globular proteins, membrane proteins and
intrinsically disordered regions remain challenging targets.

## B. Innovation

Our approach is innovative in three key ways: (1) we combine graph neural
networks with transformer architectures in a novel hybrid framework, (2) we
incorporate physics-based constraints from molecular dynamics simulations, and
(3) we focus specifically on the underserved areas of membrane proteins and
disordered regions.

## C. Approach

### C.1 Preliminary Studies

Our laboratory has published extensively on protein structure prediction methods.
In preliminary work, we demonstrated that our hybrid architecture achieves 15%
improvement in membrane protein backbone accuracy compared to existing methods.

### C.2 Research Design

We will use a phased approach beginning with model architecture development
(Year 1-2), followed by benchmark creation and validation (Year 2-3), and
concluding with integration and community tool development (Year 3-5).

# Budget Justification

Personnel costs include the PI (20% effort), two postdoctoral researchers (100%
effort each), and one graduate research assistant (50% effort). Equipment costs
include GPU cluster access for deep learning training. Travel funds support
attendance at two scientific conferences per year.
