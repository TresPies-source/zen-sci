## Research Highlight

Our latest research on *quantum error correction* has been published in the Journal of Computational Physics. The paper introduces a novel approach to stabilizer codes using `lattice surgery` techniques.

```python
def quantum_circuit(n_qubits):
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits)
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        circuit.h(i)
    return circuit
```

## Community Events
