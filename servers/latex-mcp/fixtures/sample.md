# Introduction

This sample document demonstrates the ZenSci LaTeX MCP conversion pipeline.
It includes mathematical expressions and citations for testing purposes.

## Mathematical Foundations

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ describes mass-energy equivalence.
The quadratic formula is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Related Work

As shown by Smith et al. [@smith2020], quantum computing has made significant advances.
The foundational algorithms are described in [@knuth1997].

## Conclusion

This concludes our sample document.
